### A picture is worth a thousand satoshis

#### Warning
Please be warned, this project was created for fun as a proof-of-concept and has not been thoroughly tested and vetted. Generating keys from digital files is not a viable short or long-term solution for storing Bitcoin and should not be considered beyond general, low-stake shits and giggles. The author of this project is not held responsible for any lost or stolen Bitcoin. Please use at your own risk.

#### Synopsis
This project turns any file into a mnemonic phrase allowing users to generate Bitcoin private keys and addresses based on the data URI of the provided file.

#### Demo Site
- https://coreyphillips.github.io

#### Setup
- Download or clone the [repo.](https://github.com/coreyphillips/bitimage)

#### Motivation
This was simply a fun project created as a proof-of-concept. As I learn more about Bitcoin I become tempted to tinker and experiment. This is the result of one of those experiments.
